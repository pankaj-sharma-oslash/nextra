# Nano stores

Nano stores are client side storage mechanism provided by Astro. The Nano Stores library allows you to author stores that any component can interact with.
We use nano store because
1. **They’re lightweight.** Nano Stores ship the bare minimum JS you’ll need (less than 1 KB) with zero dependencies.
2. **They’re framework-agnostic.** This means sharing state between frameworks will be seamless! Astro is built on flexibility, so we love solutions that offer a similar developer experience no matter your preference.

To use nanostores enter the following command in your terminal

```npm install nanostores```

There are many ways of creating nano stores, but in the popup we have used **Map**

### Map

Map store can be used to store objects and change keys in this object.

To create map store call ```map(initial)``` function with initial object.

```typescript
import { map } from 'nanostores'

export const profile = map({
  name: 'anonymous'
})
```

In TypeScript, you can optionally pass value type as type parameter.

```typescript
export interface ProfileValue {
  name: string,
  email?: string
}

export const profile = map<ProfileValue>({
  name: 'anonymous'
})
```

```store.set(object)``` or 
```store.setKey(key, value) ```  methods will change the store.

```typescript
profile.setKey('name', 'Kazimir Malevich')
```

Store’s listeners will receive second argument with changed key.

```typescript
profile.listen((value, changed) => {
  console.log(`${changed} new value ${value[changed]}`)
})
```
