# IndexDB

IndexedDB is a client-side NoSQL database for web applications. It provides a way for web applications to store large amounts of structured data on the client side, so that the data can be accessed and manipulated even if the user is offline.

**IndexedDB adheres to a same-origin policy.** - An origin is the domain, application layer protocol, and port of a URL of the document where the script is being executed. 
Each origin has its own associated set of databases. Every database has a name that identifies it within an origin. 
The security boundary imposed on IndexedDB prevents applications from accessing data with a different origin. 
For example, while an app or a page in http://www.example.com/app/ can retrieve data from http://www.example.com/dir/, because they have the same origin, 
it cannot retrieve data from http://www.example.com:8080/dir/ (different port) or https://www.example.com/dir/ (different protocol), because they have different origins.

To use IndexedDB, you need to create an instance of an IndexedDB database and then perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data using the database's APIs.

To create an instance of an IndexedDB database, you need to use the open() method of the indexedDB object. This method takes two arguments: the name of the database and its version number.   

```typescript
const request = window.indexedDB.open("MyTestDatabase", 1);
```

#### Populating IndexDB

Once the instance of indexDB is created we need to populate the db with some data. To populate data into an IndexedDB database, you first need to create a transaction, and then use the add() method to add the data to the object store.
Here's an example that populates an IndexedDB database with snippet data:

```typescript
// Create the database or upgrade it if it already exists
request.onupgradeneeded = (event) => {
  const db = event.target.result;
  
  // Create an object store to hold information about snippets.
  const objectStore = db.createObjectStore("snippet", { keyPath: "id" });
  
  // Create an index to search snippet by their name.
  objectStore.createIndex("snippet-name", "name", { unique: false });
};

// Populate data into the database
request.onsuccess = (event) => {
  const db = event.target.result;
  
  const transaction = db.transaction(["snippet"], "readwrite");
  const objectStore = transaction.objectStore("customers");
  
  const customerData = [
    { id: "1", name: "test-snip-1", text: "This is test snippet 1" },
    { id: "2", name: "test-snip-2", text: "This is test snippet 1" }
  ];
  
  customerData.forEach(customer => {
    objectStore.add(customer);
  });
};
```

**To perform any transaction on the indexDB the following steps must be carried out before executing the transaction like (read, write, update)**

1. Open a database connection: Use the indexedDB.open method to open a connection to the database and create a database object store if it doesn't already exist.

2. Start a transaction: Use the transaction method on the database object to start a transaction and specify the mode (e.g. 'readonly' or 'readwrite').

3. Get an object store: Use the objectStore method on the transaction to get a reference to the object store you want to perform transaction on.

#### Reading data from indexDB

To read data from an IndexedDB database, we have to follow the following steps:

1. Retrieve data: Use methods like get or getAll on the object store to retrieve data based on the key or an index.

2. Handle the result: The result is returned asynchronously via a callback function, which can access the result data.

```typescript
const request = indexedDB.open("oslash", 1);
request.onsuccess = (event) => {
  const db = event.target.result;
  const transaction = db.transaction("snippet", "readonly");
  const objectStore = transaction.objectStore("snippet");
  const request = objectStore.get("snip-name");
  request.onsuccess = (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.result);
  };
};
```

In this example, the first line opens a connection to the database named "oslash". The onsuccess event handler is called when the connection is successfully opened, and it retrieves the database object.

Next, a transaction is started with the transaction method on the database object and the mode is set to "readonly".

Then, the object store named "snippet" is retrieved with the objectStore method on the transaction.

Finally, the data is retrieved using the get method on the object store and passing in the key value "snip-name". The result is returned asynchronously via a callback function in the onsuccess event handler.

#### Writing data into indexDB

To write data to an IndexedDB database, you can follow these steps:

1. Add or update data: Use methods like put or add on the object store to add or update data. The put method updates an existing entry, while the add method adds a new entry.

2. Handle the result: The result is returned asynchronously via a callback function, which can access the result data.

```typescript
const request = indexedDB.open("oslash", 1);
request.onsuccess = (event) => {
  const db = event.target.result;
  const transaction = db.transaction("snippet", "readwrite");
  const objectStore = transaction.objectStore("snippet");
  const request = objectStore.put({ key: "1", value: "test-snip-3" });
  request.onsuccess = (event) => {
    console.log("Data written successfully.");
  };
};
```

In this example, the first line opens a connection to the database named "oslash". The onsuccess event handler is called when the connection is successfully opened, and it retrieves the database object.

Next, a transaction is started with the transaction method on the database object and the mode is set to "readwrite".

Then, the object store named "snippet" is retrieved with the objectStore method on the transaction.

Finally, the data is written using the put method on the object store and passing in an object with the key-value pair to be stored. The result is returned asynchronously via a callback function in the onsuccess event handler.

#### Updating data in IndexDB

To update data in an IndexedDB database, you can use the put method on the object store. The put method updates an existing entry or adds a new entry if the key doesn't exist.

```typescript
const request = indexedDB.open("oslash", 1);
request.onsuccess = (event) => {
  const db = event.target.result;
  const transaction = db.transaction("snippet", "readwrite");
  const objectStore = transaction.objectStore("snippet");
  const request = objectStore.put({ key: "1", value: "test-snip-4" });
  request.onsuccess = (event) => {
    console.log("Data updated successfully.");
  };
};
```
In this example, the first line opens a connection to the database named "oslash". The onsuccess event handler is called when the connection is successfully opened, and it retrieves the database object.

Next, a transaction is started with the transaction method on the database object and the mode is set to "readwrite".

Then, the object store named "snippet" is retrieved with the objectStore method on the transaction.

Finally, the data is updated using the put method on the object store and passing in an object with the key-value pair to be stored. The result is returned asynchronously via a callback function in the onsuccess event handler.

#### Deleting data from indexDB

To delete data from IndexedDB use the following code piece

```typescript
request.onsuccess = (event) => {
    const db = event.target.result;
    const transaction = db.transaction(["snippet"], "readwrite");
    const objectStore = transaction.objectStore("snippet");
    const objectStoreRequest = objectStore.delete(1);
};
request.onerror = (event) => {
    console.log("Error deleting data from database.", event);
};
```
