# Structure and flow of the code

#### Layout based design
Popup project follows a layout based structure, where layouts are wrappers that appear in each page of the project. 
    - Zaraz is one of the layout component which is present inside the folder ```popup/src/layout```.
    - Zaraz is used to manage third party libraries efficiently
        - Zaraz itself contains 3 more components in it which are - _ZeroMetricsLogger.tsx_, _HydrateStore.tsx_ and _ServiceWorker.tsx_ 

        - **ZeroMetricsLogger.tsx** is used to set up logging from the client side
        - **HydrateStore** is used to populate the nano store, so that other components can access the data present inside the nano store
        - **ServiceWorker** component is used to register the service-worker for the popup project

Since popup is built upon astro, the first page that is displayed to the screen, when we start the application, is the **index.astro** present inside ```popup/src/pages/index.astro```. And _index.astro_ calls the _link.astro_ file (which renders the _NewShortcut.tsx_ file) - so shorcut page will displayed when we run the application

> **Note:** to start the application for development run the following command ```npm run start```

snippet page can be accessed by going to this path - [```/snippet```](https://home.oslash.com/popup/snippet). If the user is not logged in he will be redirected to ```/login``` and on successful login he will be redirected to the index page

As soon as the project is served by the server, we check for the availability of shortcuts, this is handled by the component - **ShortcutAvailability.tsx** 

In both the _NewShortcut.tsx_ and _NewSnippet.tsx_ we are fetching details such as **getUserDetails**, **getCollection**, **getTagsList**, which are required by the popup page

Once the user has filled the shortcut/snippet form and they click on create, 
a graphql query will get instantiated, along with that the newly created shortcut/snippet will be stored in [indexDB](/Docs/popup/indexDB) for **faster access**, 
so that user need not wait for the graphql query to complete and then start using the newly created shortcut/snippet, 
instead as soon as they hit the create button, the shortcut will be stored in the indexDB, 
and if the user wishes to use the newly created shortcut immediately they can do so - as the data is present in the indexDB, 
this will provide a _real-time experience_ to the user.
